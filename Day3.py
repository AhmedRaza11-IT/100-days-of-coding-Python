#discussion about pip, external module and internal/built in module.
# pip: python package manager
# Built in Modules - These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly.
# External Modules - These modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of a same module with time.
