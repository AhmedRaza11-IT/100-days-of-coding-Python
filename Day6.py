# variables: Variable is like a container that holds data.
# Very similar to how our containers in kitchen holds sugar,
# salt etc. Creating a variable is like creating a placeholder in memory and assigning
# it some value. In Python, it's as easy as writing:
# 1. variables are like containers.
#
a = 1
b = True
c = "Harry"
d = None
e = 1.1
f = 1 + 2j
g = [1, 2, [3,56]]
h = (1, 2, 3)
i = {"name": "Harry", "age": 37}
j = {"1", "2", "3"}
k = {"name": "Harry", 1: [2, 3, 4]}
l = range(6)
dict1={"name":"Harry","age":37}
print(dict1)
print("The type of a is ", type(a))
print("The type of b is ", type(b))
print("The type of c is ", type(c))
print("The type of d is ", type(d))
print("The type of e is ", type(e))
print("The type of f is ", type(f))
print("The type of g is ", type(g))
print("The type of h is ", type(h))
print("The type of i is ", type(i))
print("The type of j is ", type(j))
print("The type of k is ", type(k))
print("The type of l is ", type(l))
print("The type of dict1 is ", type(dict1))
# Data types: Data type specifies the type of value a variable holds.
# This is required in programming to do various operations without causing an error.
# 1. Numeric data: int, float, complex
# 2. Text data: str
# 3. Boolean data:
# 4. Sequenced data: list, tuple
# 5. Mapped data: dict
